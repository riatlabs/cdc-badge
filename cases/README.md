# CDC Badge Cases

## ct-back-case
Case clips onto the back of the PCB. Protects battery and Rasp Pi header. Fit is
close, so make sure your printer can meet tolerances or add an outer wall
offset. Printing in PETG is recommended for semi flexible retention clips. PLA
works, but clips can break if you are not careful.
