Requires:
- 2x M4 nuts
- 2x M4x15 countersunk screws
- 4x M2x15 countersunk screws (not tested, but M3 is definitely too large)
- 4x M2 nuts

Designed for printing with 2 walls with 0.6mm nozzle; 3 walls with 0.4mm nozzle
should work fine as well.

## ct-back
Back-only case secured by clips. Exposes USB-C and SAO ports. Covers battery,
Rasp Pi header and Grove connector.

Fit is close, make sure your printer can meet tolerances or add an outer wall
offset. Printing in PETG is recommended for semi flexible retention clips. PLA
works, but clips can break if you are not careful.
